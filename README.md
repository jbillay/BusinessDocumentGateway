## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Core tables for MVP
users (id, email, password_hash, name, created_at, updated_at)
collections (id, user_id, title, client_email, deadline, status, unique_link, created_at, updated_at)
collection_items (id, collection_id, name, description, required, file_type_filter, order_index)
uploads (id, collection_item_id, filename, file_path, file_size, uploaded_at)
notifications (id, user_id, type, message, read, created_at)
```

### API Endpoints (REST)

```
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
POST /api/auth/reset-password

Collections:
GET /api/collections (user's collections)
POST /api/collections (create new)
GET /api/collections/:id (collection details)
PUT /api/collections/:id (update collection)
DELETE /api/collections/:id

Public Upload:
GET /api/public/:unique_link (collection info)
POST /api/public/:unique_link/upload (file upload)

Files:
GET /api/collections/:id/download (bulk download)
GET /api/files/:id/download (single file)
DELETE /api/files/:id
```

### File Upload Flow
1. Client visits unique link
2. Frontend uploads file to temporary storage
3. Backend validates and moves to permanent storage
4. Database updated with file information
5. Email notification sent to collection owner

3. **Iterate Fast**: Keep features minimal but functional
4. **Document Everything**: API docs, setup guides
5. **Monitor Performance**: Set up basic analytics early

### Critical Decisions to Make Early
- File size limits (start with 10MB per file, 100MB per collection)
- File type restrictions (documents, images, basic types)
- Collection expiry (default 30 days)
- User limits (start with 5 active collections per user)

## ðŸŽ¯ Launch Strategy

### Beta Launch (Week 9-10)
- [ ] 10-15 beta users from personal network
- [ ] Collect detailed feedback
- [ ] Fix critical bugs
- [ ] Refine onboarding flow

### Soft Launch (Week 11-12)
- [ ] Limited marketing to specific audience
- [ ] Content marketing (blog posts, social media)
- [ ] Gather user testimonials
- [ ] Iterate based on real usage

This roadmap focuses on delivering core value quickly while building a solid foundation for future growth. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for continuous user feedback and iteration.
